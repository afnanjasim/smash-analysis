The scripts in this directory represent a full analysis chain to produce SMASH
results for low-energy pion multiplicites, which are compared to the FOPI data
from:

W. Reisdorf et al:
Systematics of pion emission in heavy ion collisions in the 1A- GeV regime
Nucl. Phys. A781 (2007) 459-508
arXiv:nucl-ex/0610025
http://inspirehep.net/record/729436

In particular this analysis generates plots of the pion multiplicity (fig. 20)
and the pion ratio (fig. 25) as a function of beam energy.

The numerical results will be written to a file called "pion_yields.txt",
while the plots go into "FOPI_pions.pdf".
